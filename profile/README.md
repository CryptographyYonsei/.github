### Introduction
In cryptography, a side-channel attack is an attack in which a cryptosystem or security device analyzes and infers incidental physical signals from the actual computation process. Our project utilizes AI techniques to develop a model that monitors physical data generated by the system in real time and detects anomalous patterns that differ from normal patterns.
